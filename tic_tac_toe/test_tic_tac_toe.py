"""
Below is the full Python implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game, which consists of three classes:
  - Player
  - Board
  - Game
I want you to write unit tests and integration tests for all methods:

Your tests must:
- Provide **separate unit tests** for each method.
- Provide **integration tests** that show how methods work together in a Tic-Tac-Toe game scenario.
- Achieve high code coverage, branch coverage, edge coverage, and condition coverage.
- Include a brief comment or docstring in each test (or group of tests) indicating which coverage type(s) it addresses.

In particular, make sure to cover:
1. Normal gameplay scenarios (valid and invalid moves, players taking turns).
2. Edge cases such as attempting to move out of bounds, making a move on an already occupied space.
3. Error scenarios (invalid input, incorrect board updates, etc.).

Return your test code in a SINGLE code block, including all necessary imports (like `unittest`),
so it's ready to run.
